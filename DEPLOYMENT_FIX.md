# Deployment Fix Applied ✅

## Issues Identified
1. Missing `RecipientType` enum that was accidentally removed during schema optimization
2. Missing `UserAddress` schema still being imported in user endpoints
3. Deprecated Pydantic config warning

## Fixes Applied
1. **Restored RecipientType Enum** - Added back the missing enum in `app/models/schemas.py`
2. **Added Missing OrderStatus Values** - Added `DELIVERED` and `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` statuses
3. **Removed UserAddress Dependencies** - Cleaned up user endpoints to remove UserAddress imports
4. **Fixed Pydantic Config** - Updated deprecated `allow_population_by_field_name` to `populate_by_name`
5. **Updated User Endpoints** - Now use dependency injection for auth service
6. **Cleaned Up Redundant Imports** - Removed duplicate firestore imports

## Files Fixed
- ✅ `app/models/schemas.py` - Restored missing enums and fixed Pydantic config
- ✅ `app/api/v1/endpoints/order.py` - Cleaned up imports and added missing status values
- ✅ `app/api/v1/endpoints/user.py` - Removed UserAddress dependencies and updated to use DI

## Expected Result
The API should now load successfully without any import errors and all endpoints should be accessible.

## Verification Steps
1. Check logs for successful API router loading
2. Test `/health` endpoint for service status
3. Test `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint functionality
4. Verify dependency injection is working

## Performance Optimizations Maintained
All the backend optimizations completed earlier are still in place:
- ✅ Centralized repository manager with caching
- ✅ Dependency injection container
- ✅ Performance monitoring service
- ✅ Optimized schemas
- ✅ Consolidated authentication service

The deployment should now be fully functional with all optimizations active.
